# Dataset
This Stability.ipynb contains the dataset for CropYield. 
The procedure is as follows: first, import unprocessed satellite images from Google Earth Engine 
into the designated "images" directory; next, carry out image processing tasks, 
including applying a mask and clipping values, before saving the processed images to the specified "processed" folder; 
finally, generate histograms from the processed images and store the resulting histogram file in the assigned "histograms" folder.
